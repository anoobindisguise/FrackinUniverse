  ^orange;Official Wiki^reset;: frackinuniverse.miraheze.org^reset;
  
  ^cyan;6.1.17 ^reset;

  -- Mobs --
  * Doomwyrms now drop Lasombrium and Xithricite rather than Uranium and Xithricite
  * Doomwyrm gas clouds now have a slight purple hue and apply Negative Miasma

  -- Misc --
  * the 'default' tooltip for most items is now taller to allow more room for information/stats
  * Replaced the scan text of the Ark ancient holograms for non-vanilla races with more descriptive text.
  * Added many more non-job-specific dialogue lines to crew.

  -- Bugs--

  ^cyan;6.1.16 ^reset;
  
  -- Assets --
  * Added five new proximity scanners. Player sensor, NPC sensor, Monster sensor, Friendly sensor, Enemy sensor. Craft them at your wiring station, no need for further research.
  * Created five small BYOS spawn teleporters, based on the Fenerox, Kirhos, Veluu'ish, Pharitu and Thelusian vanilla teleporters, suitable for embedding into the ground.

  -- Production --
  * Updated the powered furnaces to reflect the recent ore rarity changes - the Electric Furnace can smelt all common and uncommon ores, and basic materials, the Blast Furnace can smelt rare ores and many more materials, and the Arc Smelter can smelt all ores and perform its current function of metallic hydrogen and deuterium.
  * Removed guaranteed outputs from most craftable blocks in the powered furnaces. Bonus outputs are unchanged, but infinite resource loops from these materials are no longer trivially possible.
  
  -- Companions --
  * Created an alternative to the Ore Drone III which has a greater scan range in exchange for being unable to detect caves. The current Ore Drone III has been renamed to the Mining Drone, and currently-owned instances will be otherwise unaffected by this change.
