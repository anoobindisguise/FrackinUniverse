    "First my beloved Steven lapses into a coma. For three months, nothing but worry! The doctors didn't know what the hell was wrong, and I just had to sit there waiting. Then, he wakes up babbling nonsense...or rather 'Greg gregga greg' over and over again! Then he passes painfully...but what came next was worse!",
    "We thought the lifeform was dormant. The lab techs had it in a vat near Greg...er....Steven...and the second Steven passed on it just...ripped through the glass like it was nothing! It latched right onto his body! Some foul thing lashed out, penetrated his head...and then he...he.....HE STOOD UP!",
    "But it wasn't Steven anymore. Not even remotely. The language was all different, and his whole body was coated with this...gross goop. I begged them to kill it, to burn it...but the doctors just stared! And then one tranquilized Steven and...and then me. I don't know how I got back to Earth but that's where I was when I woke up.",
    "What did they do with my Steven? Where did he go? What was that thing?"
