    "After careful examination of subject 9, I've been able to ascertain some most unusual details on the symbiote itself based on the physiology of the host. Host is human, no doubt there...there is too little body hair for this to be Apex, not to mention a complete lack of pronounced brow ridge. Based on medical data of the human species I have determined that the subject was dead for at least 24 hours prior to melding with the foreign body.",
    "Cause of death is apparently a prion of unknown origin that is keyed specifically to the human genome. It appears to be unhinged from standard quantum space, able to straddle the interdimensional realm we call sub-space and utilize this as a means of transmission. This would, interestingly enough, allow the prion to infect anyone it wanted within a range of approximately 2 light years. More research on this prion will be conducted later.",
    "After initial incubation period, the priod takes over control of the cerebral cortex. There it stimulates neurons in such a way as to somehow, through unknown means of energy transmission, stimulate the spontaneous growth of an egg. From this egg, a microbial parasite hatches within 12 to 72 hours. This parasite feasts on the hosts brain tissue, using them to construct some sort of neural link with the host at the celular level.",
    "I speculate that this is a mutation of the experimental prion approved in Protectorate Year 147 for the cleanup operations during the Floran/Hylotl conflict. Somehow the virus mutated into this new form, despite encoding to prevent this exact eventuality. This would mean that literally all populations with remaining tech associated with this prion could be an immediate threat to the Republic. Researcher Juxxa Valin 2554AN7N2 requests immediate examination of all volunteer facilities.",
    "In any case, after the incubated egg hatches it is undeniably some sort of mutated retrovirus that is birthed. It immediately begins consuming the hosts brain from the inside out, absorbing memory and motor function, and quite possibly everything else that made the host a unique individual. Soon after consumption is complete, the host body dies. The parasite severs its link immediately and consumes itself. The waste material created then does something truly strange.",
    "A tertiary birth then occurs: the virus creates a Symbiote egg in the corpse of the host. This Symbiote feeds on the tissue of the hosts body after first encasing it in a sleek and gloppy coat of slime. This process can take as long as 7 weeks. Once the body is consumed, the Symbiote awakens with a translucent slimey body that mimics that of the original host. They are a fresh slate, newly born and unique.",
    "I do find one thing sad, however: They occasionally get glimpses of their old selves, or meet old flames, perhaps hear a favorite song...and they'll struggle to remember it. They'll experience all of the related emotions, and it will seem real to them...but in no way can they ever make sense of what it might be. A newly born member of this race is completely unable to recall who they used to be. Reflect on this, but know that your perspective is not the same as theirs.",
    "This isn't sad to them, though. To them, it's all a part of their culture. But we aren't here to discuss that anyhow. This is a medical examination. Advise central to omit the last statements from the log."
