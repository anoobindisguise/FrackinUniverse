    "We must never forget how close we came to annihiliation. The Thelusians were a formidable adversary for nearly 200 years, and managed to fight us to a standstill despite our best efforts. They accomplished this not with numbers, nor with their tough chitin. No, it was their skill. Until we were able to create the Yashvarra Nyi (Light Spear) using the strange lore of the ancients as a guide...we were nothing. Once the Doctrine was in practice, and the Yashvarra perfected they were beaten back with ease.",
    "Should their formed Hive-Mind collapse as it did in those days, there will again be a war. They cannot help themselves, for we are a natural food to them, and their voracious appetite requires near constant feeding. However, we must also not forget the Doctrine. The are not our enemy at present, and the Oracles forbid war unless it is in defense of the People."
