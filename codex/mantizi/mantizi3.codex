    "It wasn't their military spending, their scientific experiments or their inherently unlikable natures that cost the Mantizi their empirical might. No, it was something else entirely that contributed to the downfall of their once great civilization. Expansionism brought them to the death-knell, as it were.",
    "Having spread too rapidly and too far among the neighboring systems stressed their economy until it reached an inevitable breaking point. The Mantizi, never great with money in the first place (they are far too hard-coded to use current resources for short-term gain, due in part to their natural evolution as a species), were not even aware of a problem until it was too late.",
    "Within twenty years, the coffers of the empire were empty. Workers could no longer be paid, and the unemployment rate rapidly reached over 87% (estimated 87.72% at the official time of dissolution). What followed was a massive civil war, and the complete slaughter of every single member of the senate. Even the Oracles were slain, their entrails used as sashes.",
    "The citizens attempted to replace the government, but too much damage had already been done. The empire, as it was, ceased to exist. The estimated death tally across their entire territory is 4,245,167,211.",
    "What remains now are numerous tribes. They cling to individual worlds, though their tendency to live lives of excess has not diminished in the least. At last count, the remaining Mantizi worlds still house over 65 billion individuals. Of that population, 32% are Artisans or Artists, 7% are philosophers, 8% work in brothels or similar professions. Clearly Mantizi enjoy expression.",
    "We cannot neglect to mention their natural combat abilities. Despite the empire no longer being a power, the old ways remain popular and are well practiced among the majority of their people due to the Vorgeth Cygna Doctrine still being held as a 'core' Virtue (a fancy way of Mantizi saying 'mandatory learning for the good of all').",
    "Only time will tell if they can once again forge a lasting empire and unite the tribes. They would be welcome voices in the Protectorate, should they once again create a viable government."
