"Recently, we discovered a massive hologram depicting a furry, canid-looking beast well over the size of a planet, tucked in the remains of one of the X'i ghost towns. We speculate that this is one of the gods they may have worshipped at one point in time. The translation of its name from runes appears to be ^orange;'ORANA'^reset;."
