    "After [REDACTED] and revisiting a nearby Floran tribe, I discovered a surprising trend that had arisen in tribal tradition. They have taken to calling their [REDACTED] 'Greenfingers.' It apparently was not limited to that one tribe either. Tribes all over the planet - and as I shortly learned, nearly every other tribe across this sector - have also taken up the practice.",

    "I am not certain if the tradition was undertaken as some long-forgotten form of flattery or simply because they associate my name with being clever, after these long [REDACTED]. Either way, I cannot say I am entirely displeased with the practice. It would seem I have left a lasting mark upon the history of my people.",

    "The tribal role of Greenfinger appears to be distinct from that of Tribesmaster, although exceptional Florans might occasionally be both. Greenfingers seem to serve as exceptionally clever, technically proficient shamen, and I have even seen evidence that they correspond with one another, acting almost as tribal envoys.",

    "It may be premature to say, but perhaps this development might herald the emergence of true civilization amongst the Floran in the absence of the Protectorate."
