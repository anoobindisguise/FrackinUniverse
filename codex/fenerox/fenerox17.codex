    "These Mantizi terror-people not as scary as the Thelusians. Nicer insects that not flesh-eat the same way. Also, more civilized. Prefer talk and talk and make and make, less killing and eating. Still not going to be delicious. Not try to taste.",
    "Kirhos says valuable trade with Mantizi, and so we respect even if chitin is skin. Why is nature make shell skin? Why is terror-people even allowed? Still think should make illegal."
