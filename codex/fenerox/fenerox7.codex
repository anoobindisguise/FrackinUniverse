    "We have met new species again, thanks to Kirhos. Is called Avians. Big problem for us there, because Avians smell and look tasty. Really, really tasty. Fenerox instinct always 'kill bird, eat bird' but us not allowed to kill and eat these birds. Also, these birds have scary shiny gem guns. Likely also dislike being eated.",
    "Secret, we think on how to taste Avians and know what is taste. Must know, because hunger makes birds even tastier. Fenerox like food, and like hunt, and like birds. Maybe us speak to Floran, see how them is gets away with kill and eat Hylotl. Then us do same for bird people."
