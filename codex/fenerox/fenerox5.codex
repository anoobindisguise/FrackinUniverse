    "We never tell Kirhos they is weaker, because they gave us technology and teach us to be better than other Fenerox. Instead, we keep Kirhos alive. In exchange, Kirhos may help Uplift all other Fenerox tribes across galaxy. Everyone benefit. Kirhos protected, We stronger. And then one day, we make Empire. We rule. But no tell anyone. Keeping secret."
