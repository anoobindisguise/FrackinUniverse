    "Floran also talk strange. Referring always to entire race and not self. Why? Explain? None make them change tongue, but Fenerox expected to speak Standard? Explain. Required needed information. Also, meat diet of Florans and being plant, them never need bathe. Smelling like rotten meat all time. We dislike.",
