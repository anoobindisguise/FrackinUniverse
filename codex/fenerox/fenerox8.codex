    "Fenerox people dislike fish. Savannah not really have fish, or many of lizurds and amfibyuns. Not understand how horrifying monster from water places is having thinking brains. Even more surprise: Hylotl is -really- thinky. Always thinking. Using lots of words and writings to explain things. Annoying.",
    "Mostly, Hylotl scary. Avoid if can, because them will talk, and when them does their three eyes do watching. Ever been watch by *three* eyes? No? Shiver-scare always. Also, eyes not really blink normal like mammal eyes. Instead, is soul-empty and horror. Avoid! Fish men keep to seas, so is easy."
