    "Nope. That is new word from Human. Nope. Is mean 'no' but sound nicer. Using to describe new race we met. X'i. Is radiation with rock skin. Can release seeds like poop, and use to make things. But standing near is unwise, we are thinking. They is eating poison glow rods for food. Remember on homeworld when Yassh Vix did, and died from lumpy growths on body? No eating of poison glow rods. Yet X'i not sick and die. Is instead get better from. Not trust.",
    "Also, X'i is not speaking like any other race. Hard understand, which means not trust because cannot make deal. Kirhos is saying deal always mark of trust. No trust. Glow people with plant feces not good. Avoid."
