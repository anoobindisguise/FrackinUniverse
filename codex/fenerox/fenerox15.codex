    "Find other race liking dark. Call self Nightar. Silly, because dark is also night. Wonder why is name? Despite, Fenerox people have new friend. Us is getting along because few words on both sides and prefer just hunt and dark. This is good. Nightar seem fearing leader like we is fearing dark-men. Maybe is same god?",
    "Nightar not understand how Fenerox survive on surface if like dark more. We is telling of burrow-cities, and then they is understanding. Still is wonder how sun not burn us, which is sad. Sun not scary. Sun is cleansing things and making heat so not die. Love sun. But night is better, because night is hunt."
