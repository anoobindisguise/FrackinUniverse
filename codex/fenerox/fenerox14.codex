    "Terror. Fear. That is what dark-men are. No touch, no talk, not be around. Avoid dark-men. Is Gallupal of legend, for sure maybe. Gallupal is eating the sun and making the night, and night is good for hunt and baby-making. But remember Gallupal is always watch, always judge, and guarding of the death-world.
