"The white mask of the Nightar warrior should be observed very carefully. There are many reasons to this, the most visible being this: the more plain the mask, the more skilled the warrior. The highest ranked among their kind wear one that is plain white, with only narrow slits for eyes.",
"The lower the rank of the warrior, the more vibrant the mask will become. Unblooded warriors (those with no battlefield experience) instead wear a black mask adorned with a singular blue stripe in the center. Their low rank also means they serve as envoys to the galaxy at large.",
"Those among the top 200 warriors do not communicate with anyone that is not of their race. Ever. Their code forbids any form of verbal congress outside of their people, no matter the reason. They will, however, communicate with gestures using head, limbs and digits.",
"Low-ranked warriors are permitted to socialize with whom they please, though doing so with too much frequency will earn them the title of Vilmaehkt. This is a grave insult, meaning Red-Blood. On their world, due to low oxygen, their blood is blue. A Vilmaehkt is a 'filthy outsider', unworthy."
